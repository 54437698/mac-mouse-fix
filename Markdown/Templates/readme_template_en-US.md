<!-- ||| Intro Text ||| -->

Mac Mouse Fix is an app for Macs that improves regular mice.

I want to make Mac Mouse Fix the best mouse driver ever! Some features are still missing at the moment, but I think it already turns regular mice into the **best input devices** for Macs! Even better than an Apple Trackpad or a Logitech MX Master mouse.

For more information on how exactly Mac Mouse Fix enhances your mouse, visit the [website](https://noah-nuebling.github.io/mac-mouse-fix-website).


<!--
easy, efficient, natural and pleasant
Better than an Apple Trackpad or a Logitech MX Master. (These are often considered some of the best input devices for Macs)

It offers amazingly natural and polished gestures and smooth scrolling that let you breeze through macOS just like an Apple Trackpad.

It lets you do almost anything right from your mouse with its powerful customization options that are so simple and intuitive that anyone can use them.

## Background

This is what I wrote on the Mac Mouse Fix website when I released the very first version during the semester break in 2019:

> My name is Noah and I made Mac Mouse Fix. When I started this project I was completely new to software development, but with the power of Google, Stack Overflow, and Apple's Developer Documentation at my fingertips I managed to learn what is necessary to deliver a solid little app that I hope will be useful for you guys. Working on Mac Mouse Fix made me discover a passion for programming, and led me to enroll in a Computer Science Degree at college, which has been awesome so far. I probably won't have a lot of time to work on Mac Mouse Fix during the semester, but please feel free to make your own contributions to Mac Mouse Fix on GitHub!

Since then, I have unfortunately struggled a lot with my mental health. And after starting out with really good grades and a nice social life, I unfortunately became too depressed and anxious to finish my degree. However, I still have a lot of passion and fun working on Mac Mouse Fix, and I hope to be able to sustain myself financially through the project and to slowly but deliberately turn it into the best mouse driver ever and an app that any Mac user with a mouse can appreciate and benefit from. Thanks so much to everyone for their support, be it through financial support, by requesting and discussing features and bugs, or by simply sharing their excitement about the app! <3 :) Thank you.

## Questions

> [!NOTE]  
> Native on Apple Silicon?
> Yes. 

(Lots of apps advertise with this but it's kind of an "of course" thing. This should also probs be under features or sth not questions?)

**Does Mac Mouse Fix track my information?**

I'm committed to your privacy. Mac Mouse Fix does not have ads and it doesn't track any information about you. 
If you have automatic updates turned on, Mac Mouse Fix will ping Github's servers every time you launch the app to ask for an update. I can't retrieve any information about that however.

**Is Mac Mouse Fix compatible with the Apple Magic Mouse?**

Mac Mouse Fix currently has no effect on the Apple Magic Mouse. I might add features in the future which work with the Magic Mouse.

**Is my Logitech / Razor Mouse compatible?**

Yes but some buttons might not work properly because poopoo custom protocol + onboard memory.

Same is true for Glorious, ?Steelseries

I want to add this but it's not coming soon!!

You can use SteerMouse or proprietary driver like Logitech Options instead.

**Can I use tilting wheel for buttons?**

No you dumbo

**Pointer Speedd / Turn off acceleration??**

Not yet, but here are alternatives <...>. Adding it soon and !! (I hope) (and better than everyone else hehe)

**Click delay**

When you click, MMF will wait to see if you're going to double click. Delete the "Double Click" Action to remove the delay. More info here.

**Blender Compatibility**

If you have actions mapped to middle button, use Scroll and navigate (or Click and drag sim?) to still navigate in Blender. Or uncapture Middle button (maybe make this a guide on its own?)

**Will Mac Mouse Fix still be Open Source now that it's monetized?**

Yes. Mac Mouse Fix will still be open source, and I don't plan to change that at any point.

This also means you can use Mac Mouse Fix for free by building it from source and disabling the licensing checks. That's perfectly fine, I just discourage sharing these cracked versions online.
And of course, on the next update, you'll get a non-cracked version which means you'll have to do this again for every update. (Or just pay $1.99 for the greatest mouse driver ever! :)

Anyone will also still be able to use source code from Mac Mouse Fix in their free and commercial products as long as they don't just sell a copy of Mac Mouse Fix without adding their own contribution.

Learn about the details in the new MMF License which MMF 3 will be licensed under.

**Can I get Mac Mouse Fix for free if I already donated?**

Yes! If you donated in 2022 or before, you can write an email to noah.n.public@gmail.com with "Free License" in the subject and a screenshot as proof and then I'll send you a 100% off discount code or something!

**How do I uninstall Mac Mouse Fix?**

You can uninstall Mac Mouse Fix by simply moving it to the bin. 

However there will be files left on your system. To get rid of these files I recommend the awesome [AppCleaner by FreeMacSoft](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/).

Unfortunately, macOS makes it infeasible for apps to properly clean up after themselves when you delete them. That's why I highly recommend using an app like AppCleaner.

## Tips

**Brightness, Volume, and Media controls right from your mouse!**

MMF Let's you use any key on your keyboard directly from your mouse.
Even keys only found on Apple keyboards like 'Increase Brightness', 'Decrease Volume' or 'Play-Pause'. 

If you don't have an Apple Keyboard at hand, hold Option (⌥) to reveal the Apple-Keyboard exclusive keys in a dropdown menu!

<img src="{repo_root}Markdown/Media/Apple-Keys-Demo.gif" width="450">

You can also use keyboard shorcuts to do anything from your mouse by hooking into other stuff like Apple Shortcuts! The possibilities are endless!

**Use Swish to manage your windows**

[Swish](https://highlyopinionated.co/swish/) is my favorite way to snap windows (/ get window snapping / manage windows on macOS). It lets you position any window so it takes up half, a quarter, or the whole screen with a single swipe on your trackpad, making it much easier to work with many windows at once. 

It's designed for trackpad gestures, but with Mac Mouse Fix you can use it from any third-party mouse!

Just set any button's "Click and Drag" action to "Scroll & Navigate" and you can snap windows with a simple click and drag.

Anything you can do by swiping with 2 fingers on an Apple Trackpad works just as well with Mac Mouse Fix!
