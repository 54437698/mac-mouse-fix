<!-- ||| Intro Text ||| -->

Mac Mouse Fix is an app for Macs that improves regular mice.

I want to make Mac Mouse Fix the best mouse driver ever! Some features are still missing at the moment, but I think it already turns regular mice into the best input devices for Macs! Even better than an Apple Trackpad or a Logitech MX Master mouse.

For more information on how exactly Mac Mouse Fix enhances your mouse, visit the [website](https://noah-nuebling.github.io/mac-mouse-fix-website).


<!--
easy, efficient, natural and pleasant
Better than an Apple Trackpad or a Logitech MX Master. (These are often considered some of the best input devices for Macs)

It offers amazingly natural and polished gestures and smooth scrolling that let you breeze through macOS just like an Apple Trackpad.

It lets you do almost anything right from your mouse with its powerful customization options that are so simple and intuitive that anyone can use them.

## Background

This is what I wrote on the Mac Mouse Fix website when I released the very first version during the semester break in 2019:

> My name is Noah and I made Mac Mouse Fix. When I started this project I was completely new to software development, but with the power of Google, Stack Overflow, and Apple's Developer Documentation at my fingertips I managed to learn what is necessary to deliver a solid little app that I hope will be useful for you guys. Working on Mac Mouse Fix made me discover a passion for programming, and led me to enroll in a Computer Science Degree at college, which has been awesome so far. I probably won't have a lot of time to work on Mac Mouse Fix during the semester, but please feel free to make your own contributions to Mac Mouse Fix on GitHub!

Since then, I have unfortunately struggled a lot with my mental health. And after starting out with really good grades and a nice social life, I unfortunately became too depressed and anxious to finish my degree. However, I still have a lot of passion and fun working on Mac Mouse Fix, and I hope to be able to sustain myself financially through the project and to slowly but deliberately turn it into the best mouse driver ever and an app that any Mac user with a mouse can appreciate and benefit from. Thanks so much to everyone for their support, be it through financial support, by requesting and discussing features and bugs, or by simply sharing their excitement about the app! <3 :) Thank you.

## Installation

Download the latest version of Mac Mouse Fix on the [website](http://noah-nuebling.github.io/mac-mouse-fix-website/).

You can also install Mac Mouse Fix through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)! Just type the following command into the terminal:

```bash
brew install mac-mouse-fix
```

You can download older versions of Mac Mouse Fix from the [version history](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/releases).

## macOS compatibility

The latest version of Mac Mouse Fix is made for **macOS 11 Big Sur** or later.
  
If you're on macOS **10.15 Catalina**, macOS **10.14 Mojave**, or macOS **10.13 High Sierra**, you can use Mac Mouse Fix [2.2.3](https://github.com/.noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/releases/tag/2.2.3) or below. Later versions of Mac Mouse Fix might still work on your machine, but they will have visual issues and some features might not work properly.
    
If you're on macOS **10.12 Sierra**, or **10.11 El Capitan**, you can use Mac Mouse Fix [2.2.0](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/releases/tag/2.2.0) or below.

## Pricing

See the [website](https://noah-nuebling.github.io/mac-mouse-fix-website#price) for an overview of the pricing for Mac Mouse Fix 3.\
Mac Mouse Fix 2 and below will remain free forever.

## Uninstallation

Uninstall Mac Mouse Fix by simply moving it to the bin. 

However there will be files left on your system. To get rid of these files I recommend the awesome [AppCleaner by FreeMacSoft](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/).

Under macOS, it is not feasible for apps to delete these leftover files by themselves when you delete the app. That's why I highly recommend using an app like AppCleaner.

## Tips

- **Manage windows with a simple Click and Drag**

  [Swish](https://highlyopinionated.co/swish/) is my favorite way to manage windows on macOS. With a simple swipe on your trackpad, it lets you position any window so it takes up half, a quarter, or the whole screen.

  Swish is designed for trackpad gestures, but with Mac Mouse Fix you can use it from any third-party mouse! Just go to Mac Mouse Fix and set any buttons "Click and Drag" action to "Scroll & Navigate" and then you can snap windows with a simple Click and Drag.

  Anything you can do with a two-finger swipe on an Apple trackpad works just as well with the "Scroll & Navigate" feature in Mac Mouse Fix.

- **Control Screen Brightness, Audio Volume, or Media Playback right from your mouse**

  Mac Mouse Fix lets you use **any key on your keyboard** directly from your mouse -
  even special keys only found on Apple keyboards that let you control Screen Brightness, Audio Volume, Media Playback, and more.

  If you don't have an Apple keyboard at hand, **hold Option (⌥)** to choose the special Apple keys.

## Questions

- **Is Mac Mouse Fix native on Apple Silicon?**

  Yes, Mac Mouse Fix runs 100% native on Apple Silicon.

- **Does Mac Mouse Fix track my information?**

  No. Mac Mouse Fix does not have ads and it doesn't track any personal information about you.\
  If you have updates turned on, Mac Mouse Fix will ping GitHub's servers every time you launch the app to ask for an update. I can't retrieve any information about that however.

- **Why is there a delay when I click?**

  When you click, Mac Mouse Fix might wait to see if you're going to double click. Delete the "Double Click" action on the "Buttons" tab to remove the delay.

- **How can I rotate in 3D apps like Blender?**

  In 3D apps like Blender, you normally Click and Drag the Middle Mouse Button to rotate the canvas.\
  But if you assign actions to the Middle Mouse Button in Mac Mouse Fix, then this won't work anymore.
  
  To solve this, you can:
  1. Assign clicking and dragging one of the buttons of your mouse to the "Scroll & Navigate" feature. This feature simulates swiping with 2 fingers on an Apple Trackpad. This will also let you rotate 3D apps! 
  2. *Uncapture* the Middle Mouse Button by deleting all actions assigned to it. See [this guide](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/discussions/112) for more info.

- **Is my mouse supported?**

  Mac Mouse Fix works with most mice. However, on certain mice designed to be used with proprietary driver software like Logitech Options, Mac Mouse Fix can't recognize all the buttons at the moment. That's because these mice communicate with your computer using a special, proprietary protocol, instead of the standard USB protocol.\
  I would love to add full compatibility for these mice at some point, but it's a ton of work and it won't be coming soon.
  
  If you're wondering how well your mouse works with Mac Mouse Fix, you can just download and test it.

- **Is the Magic Mouse supported?**

  I might add features in the future which enhance the Apple Magic Mouse, but currently, Mac Mouse Fix has no effect on it.
  
  <!-- You can use SteerMouse or proprietary driver like Logitech Options instead. -->


<!--
- **How many buttons should my mouse have?**

  To get the best experience I recommend using Mac Mouse Fix with a mouse that has at least 5 buttons. If your mouse has fewer than 5 buttons, Mac Mouse Fix still provides rich functionality and a great experience, but some features will be less easy to access compared to a 5-button mouse. With a 5-button mouse, you can really breeze through macOS in a way that's just as nice as an Apple Trackpad!
  
  To learn more, see the [trackpad section](https://noah-nuebling.github.io/mac-mouse-fix-website#trackpad) on the website.


- **Mouse brands**

  I'm not the biggest expert on mouse hardware, but I do have quite a collection now, thanks to my work on Mac Mouse Fix! If I had to make a recommendation for what mouse to buy for the best experience with Mac Mouse fix, I'd say get a smaller, chinese brand on Amazon. In my experience, these mice often have better build quality at a fraction of the price of a big brand mouse like Logitech or Roccat. Also, some models of bigger manufacturers like Logitech are made to be used with their proprietary driver software, and they won't be fully compatible with Mac Mouse Fix. If you buy a smaller brand, you can usually be sure, that they will work flawlessly with non-proprietary drivers like Mac Mouse Fix.
-->

- **Tilt-wheel support**

  Some mice let you tilt the scroll wheel left or right to scroll horizontally. Mac Mouse Fix will make this feel more natural and easy to control. But it's not currently possible to trigger other actions by tilting the scroll wheel, such as switching between desktops. I'd love to implement this feature at some point, but it's a ton of work and it won't be coming soon.
  
  <!-- This is so hard, because it would require reprogramming the mouse so that it sends button-signals instead of sending scroll-signals, when you tilt the scroll wheel. And to reprogram the mouse, would require communicating with the it through the custom vendor-specific protocol. And that's not easy. For many mice it's not even possible. -->

- **Turning off pointer acceleration**

  Mac Mouse Fix doesn't let you turn off the pointer acceleration, but if you're on **macOS 14 Sonoma** or later, you can turn off the pointer acceleration under `System Settings > Mouse > Advanced... > Pointer acceleration`.

  I plan to add really nice ways to improve pointer acceleration in the future, but I'm not sure when that's coming.

- **Will Mac Mouse Fix still be Open Source now that it's monetized?**

  Yes, Mac Mouse Fix will still be open source.

  I encourage anyone to use the source code of Mac Mouse Fix in their own projects, as long as they don't release a simple copy of Mac Mouse Fix without adding their own contribution.

  Learn about the details in the [MMF License](https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/blob/master/LICENSE) which Mac Mouse Fix 3 and later are licensed under.

  <!--
    , and I don't plan to change that at any point.
  
    This also means you can use Mac Mouse Fix for free by building it from source and disabling the licensing checks. That's perfectly fine, I just discourage sharing these cracked versions online.\
    And of course, on the next update, you'll get a non-cracked version which means you'll have to do this again for every update. (Or just pay $1.99 for the greatest mouse driver ever! :)
  -->
