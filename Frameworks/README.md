- In the update-feed branch, we're using command line tools from the Sparkle project. 
-   -> It might be good if the copy of the Sparkle project in update-feed is the same version as Sparkle.framework in this branch.

- Originally, we used Sparkle 1.26.0
- In 21. May 2024, we switched to the latest Sparkle 1.27.3
    - We decided against using SPM, because I feel like this gives me more control and transparency?
