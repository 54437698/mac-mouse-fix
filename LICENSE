# MMF License

Copyright (c) 2022 Noah Nuebling

You may do whatever you want with the Mac Mouse Fix source code and other source 
files (from here on referred to as the "MMF Source"), with the following restrictions:

- If you publish any work derived from the MMF Source, you must make it apparent in 
  some way that it is derived from the MMF Source.
- If you have created an executable program (from here on called "Your Program") 
  compiled from some source code and/or other source files (from here on called 
  "Your Source"), and if Your Source includes files or source code copied or derived 
  from the MMF Source, then you may only publish Your Program under the following 
  conditions:
	- Your Source features substantial additions to the MMF Source, such that 
	  Your Source should be considered its own, derivative work, separate from 
	  the MMF Source.
	- You don't publish Your Program under the name "Mac Mouse Fix" or a similar 
	  name that is easily confused with "Mac Mouse Fix".
	- Your Program does not contain any malware or hidden malicious content.

# Notes on the MMF License

The MMF License is a license that I wrote based on the MIT and DBAD licenses.
I designed it with 2 main goals in mind:

- To prevent people from publishing slightly altered versions of MMF, that are the 
  exact same except that they are being payed instead of me or something like that.
- To allow everyone else to do anything they want with the source code, including 
  reusing it in their own projects, and monetizing it however they like.

If you know something about copyright, I'd love to hear your feedback on whether 
the license as I formulated it fullfills these goals.
