# MMF License

Copyright (c) 2022 Noah Nuebling

You may do whatever you want with the Mac Mouse Fix source code and other source 
files (from here on referred to as the "MMF Source"), with the following restrictions:

- If you publish any work derived from the MMF Source, you must make it apparent in 
  some way that it is derived from the MMF Source.
- If you have created an executable program (from here on called "Your Program") 
  compiled from some source code and/or other source files (from here on called 
  "Your Source"), and if Your Source includes files or source code copied or derived 
  from the MMF Source, then you may only publish Your Program under the following 
  conditions:
	- Your Source features substantial additions to the MMF Source, such that 
	  Your Source should be considered its own, derivative work, separate from 
	  the MMF Source.
	- You don't publish Your Program under the name "Mac Mouse Fix" or a similar 
	  name that is easily confused with "Mac Mouse Fix".
	- Your Program does not contain any malware or hidden malicious content.

# Notes on the MMF License

The MMF License is a license that I wrote based on the MIT and DBAD licenses.
I designed it with 2 main goals in mind:

1. To prevent people with malicious intentions or who are just trying to make a quick 
   buck from publishing apps based on MMF. For example an app that looks like MMF but 
   contains malware, or an app that is just like MMF except that when you buy a license 
   someone other than me gets paid.
2. To allow everyone else who doesn't have malicious intentions to do anything they 
   like with the MMF source code, including reusing it in their own free and monetized projects.

I want the license to be Open Source in spirit but with some protections against bad actors, 
which I think might be important now that MMF is monetized.

If you know something about copyright, I'd love to hear your feedback on whether 
the license as I formulated it fullfills these goals.

Note: I just noticed that the way that the license is currently formulated it might disallow people from sharing small bug fixes or positive tweaks they made to Mac Mouse Fix. I don't know how to reformulate it to cover this case though. Basically just act in good faith and you're good.

TODO: The version-3 branch currently contains the KingIsulgard/iOS-Polynomial-Regression source code licensed under GPL. GPL doesn't allow other licenses to be used. I asked the author for permission here: https://github.com/KingIsulgard/iOS-Polynomial-Regression/issues/6. If they don't give permission, removed the library.
