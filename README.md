__Features__
* Switch between Spaces, activate Mission Control, trigger Quick Look, or use the side buttons to navigate through pages in your browser. All of that and more. Right from your mouse.
* Smooth Scrolling algorithm that strikes a great balance between fluidity and control. Allows you to change mouse scrolling direction independently of trackpad scrolling direction.
* 100% free, light on system resources, and fully open source. There is no status bar item. Mac Mouse Fix aims to be as clutter free as possible.
