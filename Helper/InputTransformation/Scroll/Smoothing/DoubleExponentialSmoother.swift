If we did that, then, if we set y to 1, it would effectively turn off the trend aspect and this would become normal smoothing. So y would become a simple dial for how much we factor in the trend. Edit: Implementation of this in NoahSmoother.swift ... Nope that's impossible to implement because the T definition is already using L, so the L definition can't use T
