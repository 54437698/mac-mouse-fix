- The Westfalia Font is the font for the original "Buy me a milkshake! :)" button. Under MMF 2 we created the button in a graphics program and simply imported the image into Xcode, but MMF 3 is localizable so we can't have images containing text. We are shipping the Westfalia font with MMF 3 because we meant to build the milkshake button in code so that it is localizable, but we transformed the milkshake button into a simple link, and so we aren't using the westfalia font at the time of writing.
