### Changes in Beta 4

- Various improvements to the user experience.
- The remap table is now grouped by button, making it much easier to parse, especially when using many actions on the same button.
- The default configuration now features lots more actions mapped to the Middle Button. Namely 'Look Up', 'Show Desktop', 'Launchpad', and 'Mission Control & Spaces'. I think that, with the new cleaned-up layout, this is not overwhelming to new users like it would have been with the old layout. It teaches users about the possibilities and it empowers users who don't like to spend much time setting things up.
- Introduces toast notifications. These allow Mac Mouse Fix to show peripheral and contextual information without obstructing what the user wants to do.
- When a button is captured or uncaptured by Mac Mouse Fix a toast appears with info on what's happening and a link to a help page. (Link is not currently working)
- When the user tries to assign an action to the Primary or Secondary Mouse Button - which is not currently supported - a toast appears providing appropriate feedback.
- Many other small improvements.

### How you can help

- Describe your thoughts and experiences with the new UI in general. Have you found anything confusing or struggled to make the app work how you want it to? Let me know!
- Share your opinions and improvement ideas on new UI text.\
   There is quite a lot of new text in the app. I'd love for it to strike a great balance between unambiguity and simplicity. I'm not great at writing so if anything strikes you as suboptimal, let me know!
- File a bug report if something goes wrong.
- If you have any other ideas or opinions, I'd love to hear them, too!
